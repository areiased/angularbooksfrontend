# Frontend Project - The Book Library

This was my first Frontend project. It was made using Angular 9 and Material UI was heavily used. It's fully responsive for mobile and desktop.

It receives data from a pre-built API ( `https://openlibrary.org/developers/api` ), formats it and feeds the frontend/website UI with it.
The website has a search function that searches by author, book title or other tags.

After you select a book, the client asks the API for all the info from that book and displays it accordingly.

This website is available for vising and testing [HERE](http://bookslibrary.eduardocorreia.epizy.com/) (temporary webhost)

For offline use:
- This repo has a folder called backend (`/backend`) that inside has a small part of the api in .json format and instructions on how to run it for offline, localhost testing.
