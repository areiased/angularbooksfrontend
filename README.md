# Frontend Project - The Book Library

This was my first Frontend project. It was made using Angular 9 and Material UI was heavily used. It's fully responsive for mobile and desktop.

It receives data from a pre-built API (openlibrary.org), formats it and feeds the frontend/website UI with it.
The website has a search function that searches by author, book title or other tags.

After you select a book, the client asks the API for all the info from that book and displays it accordingly.

This website is available for vising and testing [HERE](http://bookslibrary.eduardocorreia.epizy.com/) (temporary webhost)
