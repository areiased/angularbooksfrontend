# Frontend Project - The Book Library

This was my first Frontend project. It was made using Angular 9 and Material UI was heavily used. It's fully responsive for mobile and desktop.

It receives data from a pre-built API ( `https://openlibrary.org/developers/api` ), formats it and feeds the frontend/website UI with it.
The website has a search function that searches by author, book title or other tags.

After you select a book, the client asks the API for all the info from that book and displays it accordingly.

This website is available for vising and testing [HERE](http://bookslibrary.eduardocorreia.epizy.com/) (temporary webhost)

#### For offline use:
1. This repo has a folder called backend (`/backend`) that inside has a small part of the api in .json format and instructions on how to run it for offline, localhost testing. It has a file `INSTRUCTIONS_BACKEND.txt` with instructions in it. Use it to turn on the backend API before continuing.
2. After having the API up and running (and saying `listening at localhost:3000` or something similar in the terminal), open another terminal, navigate to the ROOT path of this project "`/`" with `cd /*path-to-root-of-this-project*/` and just run `npm start`. Let it compile, when it stops, leave it running.
3. Open your browser on the same computer and navigate to `localhost:4200` in your URL address bar.
4. Profit?
