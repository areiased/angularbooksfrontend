to run the backend API for testing the frontend website offline or without needing to connect to external APIs:

1- Have NodeJS installed
2- Open a new terminal window
3- Navigate to the *ProjectRoot*/backend folder of this project (with " cd /*path to project root*/backend ")
4- type " npm ci " and press enter
5- type " node ./index.js " and press enter
6- It should now say "listening on localhost:3000", leave it running.

7- This API now responds to any request made to " localhost:3000/ "

Now just run the Angular website normally. Instructions in Readme.md, root of this project/github page
